The cpm platform
=================

cpm is an i80-based BSP that generates CP/M executables that can be run on any
CP/M-compliant machine.

CP/M has special needs in many ways, the main one being that it doesn't
support byte-accessible files --- only complete 128-byte sectors can be read
or written. The port's read/write/open/close/lseek etc should handle this
transparently, but trying to write a fragment of a sector will involve a
read/modify/write cycle. No buffering is done (that's stdio's job).

File descriptors 0, 1 and 2 represent the console, as usual.

In addition, there's a special interface to give applications direct access
to CP/M. See include/cpm.h for details.

Floating point is not supported and attempts to use floating-point numbers
will cause the program to terminate.

Example command line
====================

ack -mcpm -O -o cpm.com examples/paranoia.c

The file cpm.com can then be run.

(Although note that Paranoia is very big, and you'll need a CP/M machine with
lots of memory for it to fit. Which it does, just.)
