The linux386 platform
=====================

linux386 is an i386-based BSP that produces Linux ELF executables.

This port only implements a very limited number of system calls; basically,
just enough to make the demo apps run. Adding more is easy, but there are some
subtleties that require more thought. The port should be considered only in
proof-of-concept stage right now.

Important note: you *can't* link access ELF shared libraries from these
executables. In other words, you have to all your work from inside ACK.

IEEE floating point is available, but requires an FPU.

The executables are generated with aelfslod and are extremely simple; there's
one rwx ELF section which contains all the application's code and data. This
is not optimal, but it does work.


Bugs
====

isatty() is a stub and always returns 0.


Example command line
====================

ack -mlinux386 -O -o linux386.exe examples/paranoia.c

The file linux386.exe can then be run on a i386 Linux machine (or on an
emulation thereof).
