The msdos386 platform
=====================

msdos386 is an i386-based BSP that produces DPMI DOS executables. It should
have the same functionality as msdos86 (as the libc is all the same code), but
has been much less well tested.

The code runs in flat 32-bit mode, so normal 32-bit pointers work with no
worries about segmentation. It requires a DPMI host to run; it was tested with
CWSDPMI. It will _not_ automatically load the host --- you need to manually
install the DPMI hsot first.

IEEE floating point is available, but requires an FPU.


Example command line
====================

ack -mmsdos386 -O -o msdos386.exe examples/paranoia.c
