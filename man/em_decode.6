.SH NAME
em_decode,em_encode \- compact to readable EM and v.v.
.SH SYNOPSIS
/usr/em/lib/em_decode [ inputfile [ outputfile ] ]
.br
/usr/em/lib/em_encode [ inputfile [ outputfile ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Most programs involved with the EM project only produce and accept
EM programs in compact form.
These files are only machine readable.
A description of this compact form can be found in [1].
To inspect the code produced by compilers or to patch them for one reason
or another, you need human readable assembly code.
Em_decode will do the job for you.
.PP
Em_decode accepts the normal compact form in both optimized and
unoptimized form
.PP
Sometimes you have to make some special routines directly
in EM, for instance the routines implementing the system calls.
At these times you may use em_encode to produce compact routines
out of these human readable assembly modules.
.PP
The first argument is the input file.
The second argument is the output file.
Both programs can act as a filter.
