The file 'table' in this directory contains a back end table for the
MC68020 processor as well as one for the MC68000. Both tables use 4 bytes
for words as well as for pointers. The table must be preprocessed first
by the C preprocessor. If the -Dm68k4 flag is used when preprocessing, a
code generator for the m68k4 is generated, otherwise a m68020 codegenerator
is produced.	(See Makefile: PREFLAGS)
The m68k4 cg can very well be used for the MC68010 processor, for it makes
rather efficient use of the 68010 loop mode.

The mach.[ch] files are also suitable for both the m68020 and the m68k4.
