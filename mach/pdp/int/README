In this directory is a complete interpreter for EM-code on a
PDP 11, written in Unix assembly language.
The interpreter is split up in 7 files, em.v1 up to em.v7.
There exist assembler options .test .opfreq .flow .count .prof
and .last.
.test tests undefined integers, bad arrays etcetera
.opfreq makes a table of the usage of othe em-opcodes
.flow makes a table of the used lines
.count makes a count table of the used lines
.prof estimates the amount of time spent on each source line
.last gives a table of the last executed lines and files
The interpreter writes its runtime information on a file
em_runinf, which is converted to human readable files
em_last, em_opfreq, em_profile, em_flow and em_count by
the program eminform, for which we also have an assembler
source in this directory.
Because the size of the interpreter just exceeds 8k, it is
advisible to have either .prof or .test turned off on a machine
without separate I and D when a large user program is running.
