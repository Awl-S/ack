The file 'table' in this directory contains a back end table for the
MC68020 processor as well as one for the MC68000. Both tables use 2 or 4 bytes
for words and 4 bytes for pointers. The table must be preprocessed first
by the C preprocessor.
The file "whichone.h" specifies which code generator is generated:
it #defines either TBL68000 or TBL86020, and it defines WORD_SIZE to either
2 or 4.
The m68k4(TBL68000) cg can very well be used for the MC68010 processor,
for it makes rather efficient use of the 68010 loop mode.

The mach.[ch] files are also suitable for both the m68020 and the m68k[24].
