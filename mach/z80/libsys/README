This directory contains files for three different environments:
- The Hermac computer.
- The Nascom computer.
- A CPM system.

The default system used is the Hermac on which this software was
tested. The Nascom environment has been known to work too.
The CPM files are included as an example only. These have never
been tested.

The LIST file determines which system is used.
