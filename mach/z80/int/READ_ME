The interpreter contained here is tested under CP/M on a RC702 Z80
microcomputer. Make it by typing `doas'.
E.out files to interpret must be made with a special Pascal library
using whatever means available, because the UNIX and CP/M conventions
about end of file and end of line differ.
Then the following sequence can be used to transmit it to CP/M.
cv <e.out >file.cv
dl file.cv file.hex
< Transmission to file.hex under CP/M using pip >
LOAD FILE

The resulting file.com can be used as an argument to the interpreter.
This implementation has been tested but is not guaranteed to be complete.
Simple UNIX-system calls have been implemented but anything except
terminal I/O has not been thoroughly tested.
Please send any errors in the implementation to
