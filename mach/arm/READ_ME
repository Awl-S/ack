These are the comments as I received them from Albert Koelmans.
The only thing I did was adapt the installation mechanism for ACK, and
made some adaptions to de code generator to support the improved FP package.
I also removed some comments that were no longer up-to-date.

AMSTERDAM COMPILER KIT - BACKEND FOR ACORN RISC MACHINE PROCESSOR
===========================================================================

This file contains some advice on how to go about installing the ARM backend
for the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK), followed by a shar file containing the
backend itself. In what follows, ~ will denote the ACK root directory (on
most systems, this will be /usr/em), also called EMHOME in most makefiles.

Make sure that your PATH includes ~/bin

cd to ~/bin, and type 
   ln ack arm

cd to ~/mach/proto/ncg, and inspect file param.h. The constant MAXEMLINES
should be at least 40. Edit the file if necessary.

cd to ~/util/ncgg, and inspect file param.h. The constant MAXNODES should
have as parameter at least 1200. If this is not the case, edit the
file and type 'make install' to generate a new ncgg.

If some compilations fail, inspect file Out in the appropriate subdirectory
to find the cause.

ACK will create an a.out file which includes an ACK header and symbol table.
Use the cv program to strip these off, after which the executable should be
downloaded onto an Archimedes machine and have it's type set to FF8.

Acknowledgements: the first version of the backend was written by an anonymous
student at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. The code generator was further
developed and debugged by Albert Koelmans. Andrew Michael wrote most of the
assembler sources. A simple RiscOs interface was added by Albert Koelmans.
All of this involved extensive help from Ceriel Jacobs. The assertion in the
ACK documentation that writing a backend is a major task is certainly true...
