If you want to run pascal programs that use local files, you must create a
subdirectory called 'plf' in the current directory. This directory holds the
temporary files, and will NOT be automatically cleaned up when the program
exits.

This is the result of the fact that
1) a Unix absolute pathname is hard wired into the runtime libraries
2) Unix allows you to unlink open files, which RiscOs doesn't.

In other words, it is not my fault....

amk.
