	! Two system calls (gtty and stty) in the m68000 tail_mon library
	! were not really system calls but they used _ioctl. The m68020 machine
	! the table was tested on used real system calls, and we'll use
	! them here.
	! There were also three calls (ftime, lock and dup2) that were in the
	! m68000 library, but were not included in the list of system calls
	! for the m68020 that was given to me. We'll include them anyway.
	! The original gtty and stty files are included here.
	! Note however that the 68000 machine (the Mantra) needs the parameters
	! to system calls in registers, while the m68020 machine this table was
	! tested on wanted the parameters on the stack
	!
	! Also read the comments in the signal.s file!
