The file "table" is too large. The "cgg" program cannot generate
"tables.h" and "tables.c" on a PDP 11/44.
Therefore the distribution includes two files "tables1.c" and "tables1.h",
which you can copy to "tables.c" and "tables.h".
Make sure "tables.c" and "tables.h" are newer than "table",
before trying again. They also must be newer than the "cgg" program
(../../../lib/cgg).
