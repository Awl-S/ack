This file contains things that I have noticed need fixing, but have not
yet been fixed. Everything here should be reasonably low priority. Some
bugs have been bodged around to make things work; these are all marked in
the source with FIXME tags.


* util/int needs to be rewritten to emulate sgtty with termios; look for
  FIXMEs.

* mach/i80/dl/nascom.c needs to be rewritten to use termios, not sgtty.
