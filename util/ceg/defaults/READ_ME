This directory contains the default EM_CODE(3L) interface. That is :
       1) message-instruction are ignored.
       2) pseudo-instruction are almost machine independent, so they are 
	  implemented completely. *)
       3) storage-instruction are almost machine independent, so they are 
	  implemented completely. *)
       4) The other EM instructions generate a "not implemented"
	  message.

The file "pseudovars.c" contains two global variables. 'locals_created' tells if
the prolog is exected or not. 'Busy' tells if the code expander is running
or not.


*) The necessary constants should be defined by the table writer.
