# $Id$

Various small but non-trivial test programs that have been useful in
testing and debugging the EM interpreter.

E.out format files are identified by the suffices .em22, .em24 and .em44.
The Makefile will produce these if called like:

	make X.em24

where X.[cp] is a C or Pascal program.  The Makefile has no facilities
for multi-file programs.

Awa.p is used by the Makefile in ../src, to do everyday testing; it must be
present.
