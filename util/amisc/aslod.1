aslod \- ACK simple loader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aslod
[\-h] [\-v] [\-p prefixfile] inputfile outputfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I aslod
converts an absolute ack.out file into a simple binary memory dump.
It is suitable for producing RAM images, executables for
simple operating systems such as CP/M, DOS, etc.
.PP
The input file must contain exactly four segments: TEXT, ROM,
DATA and BSS, in that order, all occupying contiguous memory.
The file must have all references resolved and be linked to a
fixed address. aslod will dump the segments, in order, such
that the first byte of TEXT is at offset 0 in the file
(regardless of where it is in memory).
.PP
If a prefix file is specified, this is prepended to the output before writing.
No changes to the output itself are made.
