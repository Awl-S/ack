To install LLgen, proceed as follows:

- create a directory to put the libraryfiles in, f.i.
	/usr/local/lib/LLgen
- cd to the src directory
- adapt the file machdep.c, should be easy
- adapt the Makefile, changing the options to the C-compiler if
  necessary.
- change back to this directory
- edit the Makefile. LIBDIR should be set to the directory for the
  library files, INSTALLDIR should be set to the directory where LLgen
  is to be put.
- now type 
	make firstinstall
- This should do all the work.

LLgen.1 contains a man-page.
