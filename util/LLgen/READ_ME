INTRODUCTION
============

LLgen is a LL(1) parser in the style of yacc. It will generate an efficient
recursive descent parser for Extended Context-Free grammars, with an optional
non-correcting error recovery mechanism.

For more information, see the white papers in the doc directory. (You may need
to build LLgen first to be able to read them.)

INSTALLATION
============

LLgen depends on the following software:

    gcc: currently, LLgen only builds on gcc, due largely to the lack of any
        non-gcc test systems. Please contact the support mailing list (see
        below) if this is a problem.

	groff and grap: this is used to build the documentation.
        
LLgen uses make as its build tool. To build, do:

    make install

This will compile LLgen and install it into /usr/local (which you must be able
to write to). If you want it installed elsewhere, change the PREFIX variable:

	make install PREFIX=/home/dg
    
(If you do change the prefix, you must do a `make clean` first, or else the
installed binary will look for its libraries in the wrong place.)

USING LLGEN
===========

Please see the white papers in PREFIX/share/doc/LLgen, or the man page (called
LLgen).

LLgen itself uses a parser compiled in LLgen, so you can study the files in the
src directory for examples. If you wish to modify LLgen's own parser, the
bootstrap.sh script will update LLgen's source from the parser *.g files.
LLgen itself may then be recompiled in the usual way. (Although you may want to
keep a copy of a known good LLgen around in case you break something!)

SUPPORT
=======

LLgen is part of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (although standalone and
distributed seperately). For more details, please see:
