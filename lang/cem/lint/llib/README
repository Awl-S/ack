This directory contains the standard lint libraries.  Normally, nothing
needs to be done here.  The standard library llib-lc contains all entries
from termlib, curses and math as well, which provides the user with
advance warnings if he inadvertently uses a global name that is also
used by one of these libraries.

A file with a UNIX 7 view of the system calls is provided, named unix7.c.
If need be it can be updated and merged into llib-lc by calling

	make llib-lc  (or just make)

If one of the other entries is a shade off, it is unsually easier to edit
llib-lc by hand.

Empty files for llib-ltermlib, llib-lcurses and llib-lm are provided
for compatibility.
