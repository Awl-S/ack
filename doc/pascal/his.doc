The purpose of this project was to make a Pascal compiler which should satisfy
the conditions of the ISO standard. The task was considerably simplified,
because parts of the Modula-2 compiler were used. This gave the advantage of
increasing the uniformity of the compilers in ACK.
.br
While developing the compiler, a number of errors were detected in the Modula-2
compiler, EM utility modules and the old Pascal compiler.
