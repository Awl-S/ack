Comparison with the Pascal-VU compiler

In this chapter, the differences with the Pascal-VU compiler [IM2] are listed.
The points enumerated below can be used as improvements to the compiler (see
also Chapter 11).

Deviations
.LP
.sp
- large labels
.in +3m
only labels in the closed interval 0..9999 are allowed, as opposed to the
Pascal-VU compiler. The Pascal-VU compiler allows every unsigned integer
as label.
.in -3m

- goto
.in +3m
the new compiler conforms to the standard as opposed to the old one. The
following program, which contains an illegal jump to label 1, is accepted
by the Pascal-VU compiler.

.nf
\fBprogram\fR illegal_goto(output);
\fBlabel\fR 1;
\fBvar\fR i : integer;
\fBbegin\fR
	\fBgoto\fR 1;
	\fBfor\fR i := 1 \fBto\fR 10 \fBdo\fR
	\fBbegin\fR
		1 : writeln(i);
	\fBend\fR;
\fBend\fR.
.fi

This program is rejected by the new compiler.
.in -3m

.NH 2
Extensions
.LP
.sp
The extensions implemented by the Pascal-VU compiler are listed in
Chapter 5 of [IM2].
.sp
- separate compilation
.ti +3m
the new compiler only accepts programs, not modules.

- assertions
.ti +3m
not implemented.

- additional procedures
.ti +3m
the procedures \fIhalt, mark\fR and \fIrelease\fR are not available.
.bp
- UNIX\(tm interfacing
.ti +3m
the \-c option is not implemented.
.FS
\(tm UNIX is a Trademark of Bell Laboratories.
.FE

- double length integers
.ti +3m
integer size can be set with the \-V option, so the additional type \fIlong\fR
is not implemented.


.NH 2
Compiler options
.LP
.sp
The options implemented by the Pascal-VU compiler are listed in
Chapter 7 of [IM2].
.sp
The construction "{$....}" is not recognized.

The options: \fIa, c, d, s\fR and \fIt\fR are not available.

The \-l option has been changed into the \-L option.

The size of reals can be set with the \-V option.
