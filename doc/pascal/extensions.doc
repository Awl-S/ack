\h'-11u'The underscore is treated as a letter when the \-u option is turned
on (see also section 5.2). This is implemented to be compatible with
Pascal-VU and can be used in identifiers to increase readability.
.sp
.IP "\fBISO 6.1.4:\fR"
\h'-12u'The directive \fIextern\fR can be used in a procedure-declaration or
function-declaration to specify that the procedure-block or function-block
corresponding to that declaration is external to the program-block. This can
be used in conjunction with library routines.

\h'-22u'An alternative representation for the following tokens and delimiting
characters is recognized:
.in +5m

\h'-1u'A conformant array parameter can be passed as value conformant array
parameter without the restrictions imposed by the standard. The compiler
gives a warning. This is implemented to keep the parameter mechanism orthogonal (see also Chapter 4).

\h'-16u'If the value of the argument \fITotalWidth\fR of the required
procedure \fIwrite\fR is zero or negative, no characters are written for
character, string or boolean type arguments. If the value of the argument
\fIFracDigits\fR of the required procedure \fIwrite\fR is zero or negative,
the fraction and '.' character are suppressed for fixed-point arguments.
