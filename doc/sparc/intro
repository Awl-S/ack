The language EM is an intermediate language for use in compiler
construction.
In this paper we describe the construction of a so-called fast backend
which translates EM code to assembler for SPARC processors.
.br
Our construction deviates strongly from the usual procedure. We have
devised and implemented a virtual stack with which it is possible to
generate very acceptable code without much loss in compile time.
