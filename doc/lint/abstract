This document describes an implementation of a program which
does an extensive consistency and plausibility check on a set
of C program files.
This may lead to warnings which help the programmer to debug
the program, to remove useless code and to improve his style.
The program has been used to test itself and has found
bugs in sources of some heavily used code.
