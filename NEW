It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
Many problems with the previous distribution have been fixed.
The major additions are:

	- an ANSI C compiler
	- a LINT C program checker, both non-ansi and ansi
	- an Intel 80386 back-end
	- a SPARC code expander
	- a source level debugger for Pascal, Modula-2, and ANSI C
	- an Acorn Archimedes back-end
	- code-expanders for VAX, Intel 80386 and Motorola M68020 processors,
	  allowing the creation of very fast compilers.
