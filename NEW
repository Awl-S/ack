What's new:
	A lot of things have changed since that previous distribution.
It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
The major additions are:
	- Basic frontend
	- New codegenerator
	- LL(1) parser generator
	- Vax backend with 4-byte wordsize
	- Motorola 68000 backend with 4-byte wordsize
	- Motorola 68000 interpreter for 2- and 4-byte wordsize
	- Z8000 assembler and backend.
	- 6805 assembler
	- NatSem 16032 assembler
	- Intel 8080 backend
	- Zilog Z80 backend
	- Signetics 2650 assembler
