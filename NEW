What's new:
	A lot of things have changed since the previous distribution.
It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
The major changes are:
	- a new C-compiler and runtime system
	- a new C preprocessor
	- new assembler framework, allowing the generation of relocatable
	  object code for most processors
	- new versions of all assemblers, using the new assembler framework
	- a new link-editor, linking is now a separate and fast phase for most
	  machines
	- improved Pascal compiler, now also handles 4-byte wordsize
	- Motorola M68020 backend and assembler
	- improved version of LL(1) parser generator, producing faster code
	- a new language: Occam
