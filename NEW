It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
The major additions are:

	- a new language: Modula-2
	- a much improved 8086 back-end; unfortunately still only
	  small model
	- floating point package, usable with most back-ends
	- cross-compilation to a Microsoft Xenix V3 80286 system
