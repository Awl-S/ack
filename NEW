It is not wise to mix files created by the previous version of the Kit
with files belonging to this version, although that might sometimes work.
Many problems with the previous distribution are fixed.
The major additions are:

	- a new language: Modula-2
	- a much improved 8086 back-end; unfortunately still only
	  small model
	- floating point package, usable with most back-ends
	- cross-compilation to a Microsoft Xenix V3 80286 system
	- cross-compilation to a PC running Minix
	- cross-compilation to an Atari ST running Minix
