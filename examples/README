A few notes on the examples
---------------------------

This directory contains a handful of working example programs that can be
built with the ACK. They're intended as a convention source of test code
and as a starting point when writing your own programs.

They consist of:

hilo.c             ANSI C version of the Hi/Lo game
hilo.b             Basic version of the Hi/Lo game
hilo.mod           Modula-2 version of the Hi/Lo game
hilo.ocm           Occam 1 version of the Hi/Lo game
hilo.p             Pascal version of the Hi/Lo game

paranoia.c         An ancient public domain K&R C adventure game

Enjoy.
