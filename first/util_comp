# compiler set for producing runnable binaries (possibly using $(UTIL_HOME)).
# This must describe the compiler with which $(UTIL_HOME) has been compiled.
# If $(TARGET_HOME) is identical to $(UTIL_HOME), which usually will be
# the case, this part does not have to be changed. Otherwise (when you are
# cross-compiling ACK), you will have to change this part. Probable
# replacements are given in comments. Maybe the installation script
# has already changed them, but they should be checked to be sure.
