6.0pre2

  Much simplified the syscall interface by disabling libmon and instead
  calling the syscalls directly. Disabled the K&R C compiler and libc because
  it doesn't actually gain us anything and has a high maintenance load --- the
  ANSI C compiler works fine with K&R C. Adapted the rest of the system to
  build with the ANSI C compiler. Rewrote the pc86 syscall interface and added
  linux386 support, using the i386 code generator. Lots and lots of bugfixes
  and tweaks everywhere.
  
6.0pre1

  First working version of the 6.0 release stream. Working frontends: both C
  compilers, Pascal, Modula-2, Basic and Occam. Working backends: i86. Working
  platforms: pc86, the very noddy testbed setup that produces floppy disk
  images.
